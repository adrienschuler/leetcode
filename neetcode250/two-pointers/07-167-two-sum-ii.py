Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        l, r = 0, len(numbers) - 1

        while l < r:
            curSum = numbers[l] + numbers[r]
            if curSum > target:
                r -= 1
            elif curSum < target:
                l += 1
            else:
                return [l + 1, r + 1]
